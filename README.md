# SinWaves Login Interview Question 

The project starts as an empty repo, please download node if you don't already have it installed to start the project. [node download page](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Project Description
Create a React based login that stores a user email and password in a MongoDB database and allows a user to login to a profile page. You are welcome to use any libraries you like. 


## Setup
We recommend using MLab for a database because itâ€™s really easy for you and allow us to test your application without setting up our own database locally. [mlab's website](https://mlab.com/)

Follow the ```npm init``` instruction to start, be sure to add the repositories git link along with your name as the author. 

You are welcome to use any react setup you like, I recommend ```create-react-app``` but you could use next.js, or just setup Babble and Webpacks manually if you would like. 

Please use ````git commit -m "Useful comment"```` often so we can see how you completed this project in steps.
